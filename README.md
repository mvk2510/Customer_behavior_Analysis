📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from data loading and exploration to cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and dashboard creation. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in a clear, business-focused manner.

The project highlights practical skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization, making it suitable for real-world analytics roles.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data related to business operations (e.g., customers, sales, or user activity).

Data was loaded into Python for analysis and also imported into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for querying.

Key aspects reviewed:

Data types and structure

Missing and inconsistent values

Overall data quality

(Dataset source can be internal / provided / anonymized as applicable.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, WHERE, subqueries)

Dashboard Tool (Power BI / Tableau / Excel)

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas

Verified schema and data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis

Identification of trends, patterns, and anomalies

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized formats and corrected inconsistencies

SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into SQL Server

Wrote queries to answer business-focused questions

Used aggregations, joins, and filters for deeper insights

Dashboard Creation

Built an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends

Focused on clarity, usability, and business relevance

📈 Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis over time

Category-wise or segment-wise breakdowns

Filters for interactive exploration

The dashboard is designed for non-technical stakeholders and supports quick decision-making.

✅ Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns within the data
